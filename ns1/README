Stand-alone NS1 Crypt/Decrypt Tool 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tool can crypt/decrypt {NS1}  password hashes used by the Solaris Native LDAP
implementation.  It is based on the work of Iain Patterson who was kind enough to
blog the process/code and save me the time of doing it myself.  See his entry here:
